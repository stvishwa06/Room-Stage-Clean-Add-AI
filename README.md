#### 🚀 AI-Powered Interior Photo Editing for Cleaning, Staging & Adding Items

The app is a real estate image editing application that uses advanced AI models to transform interior photos. It lets you clean unwanted objects, stage rooms in different styles, and add furniture or décor with just a few clicks or prompts. The app makes creating high-quality, photorealistic room visuals fast, intuitive, and perfect for real estate listings or interior design mockups.

#### ✨Enhanced with Multiple Angles and Video Generation

Users can generate new views from any camera angle and create dynamic videos from static images. It offers full control over azimuth (horizontal rotation), elevation (vertical angle), and zoom (camera distance), allowing realistic visualizations from floor-level, eye-level, or top-down perspectives. Videos can then be generated with smooth motion, perfect for virtual walkthroughs, interior design, or real estate presentations.

#### 2. Cleaning Mode 🖌️❌
- Remove unwanted objects with two methods:  
  1. **Prompt Mode** – simply type what to remove (e.g., "remove old sofa").  
  2. **Polygon Selection** – draw a polygon around the object for precise removal.

#### 5. Multiple Angles & Camera Control 🔄📐
Generate new views of a room from different camera positions using a single image.  
Control **azimuth** (horizontal rotation), **elevation** (vertical angle), and **zoom** (camera distance) to visualize spaces from floor-level, eye-level, or top-down perspectives.

#### 6. Video Generation 🎥✨
Convert static room images into smooth, immersive videos.  
Use simple text prompts such as *“360-degree rotation”* or *“slow pan across the room”*, and select a duration of 5 or 10 seconds to create realistic walkthroughs, virtual tours, or dynamic presentations.
